</p>
<h2>Important Notice</h2>
Each version of the Microsoft Snapshot Tools has added features and functionality along with software improvements.  We have been working for quite some time to extend the support beyond only <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture">SAP HANA on Large Instance (HLI)</a> to also supporting <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-solution-architectures#sap-hana">Virtual Machines + Azure NetApp Files (VM + ANF)</a>. As part of this effort, we have also been taking customer feedback and aimed to better future proof the tools for more scenarios and fundamental investments.  We are happy to announce that as of <b>21/April/2021</b>, the new tool, <b>AzAcSnap</b>, became Generally Available. 
</p>
AzAcSnap provides a more modern experience to enable DevOps style deployment and management, provides both SAP Hana on HLI and VM + ANF support, addresses major customer feedback and pain points, and future proofs solution architectures much better than the previous version.
</p>
The Microsoft Snapshot Tools Version 4.3 (available on Github) is no longer being actively developed, and might be removed from Github altogether. All of its features are now available in the replacement tool Azure Application Snapshot Tool (aka AzAcSnap), which is available at: https://aka.ms/azacsnap. Please upgrade and leverage AzAcSnap for all of your needs there.
